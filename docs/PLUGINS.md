# Lark plugins

These plugins use the existing local plugin host. Each one stays **off** until you turn them on in **Settings → Plugins**, and each one has its own options there. A plugin never receives the token. The scripts in `plugins/` do not call the network.

## Message logger

Turn this on and Lark keeps a copy of edited and deleted messages on this device.

- A deleted message stays in the channel, greyed out, with a Deleted label. It is not sent back to Discord.
- An edited message keeps the earlier drafts under the current text.
- **Show deleted messages** and **Show edit history** can be turned off without wiping the log. **Clear log** removes it.
- The log stops at 200 messages, and each one keeps up to 8 earlier drafts.

## Call Timer

The voice panel shows how long the call has been up.

- **Connected** starts the clock when the call connects.
- **Join** starts it when you join, including the connecting time.
- **Hours when needed** reads `1:05` until an hour has passed, then `1:01:01`.
- **Always show hours** reads `0:00:03`.

The clock stays on this device. It does not tell anyone else.

## Volume Booster

Right-click someone in voice and the volume slider can go past 200%.

- **200%**, **300%**, or **400%** is the ceiling while the plugin is on.
- **Mute for you** still silences that person. The slider position is kept.
- Turning the plugin off sends playback at 200% again. A higher level you already set is kept for the next time you turn it on.

The extra gain is only applied to that person's playback on this computer.

## Better timestamps

The clock under each message can read as `3m ago` or as a clock time.

- **Relative** and **Absolute** switch the label. Hover or focus the time for the full local date, including seconds.
- **12-hour** and **24-hour** choose the clock. The hover date uses the same choice.
- The relative label refreshes about twice a minute.
